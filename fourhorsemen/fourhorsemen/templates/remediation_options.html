          <h3>Remediation Options</h3>
          <p>We didnâ€™t ask our survey respondents this exact question, but we noticed a trend in what remediation options they preferred to apply to the messages they saw. We provided them with options that included common and relatively punitive actions, along with uncommon but potentially useful remediative actions. The main difference between those two might be considered as the difference between a short-term solution and longer-term solution: i.e. dealing with the symptom (harassing or violent messages) rather than the underlying problem (non-compliance with social norms, mental health issues, etc.).</p>
