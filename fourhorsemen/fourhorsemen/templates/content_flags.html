            <h3>Safety in Numbers</h3>
            <p>You probably rated it about the same as you did before. We tested a small selection of visual flags on the messages, expecting participants to rate them higher for harassment. However, that did not turn out to be true to a statistically significant percentage. We believe that the violence present in the messages we showed led to that result.</p>
            <p>However, one interesting result did emerge: when there was a flag present, users were significantly more likely to opt to remove the message from the platform (as one of their preferred remediation options). We think this shows that users are more willing to remove content that they see as harassing, if there is safety in numbersâ€”i.e. if they know that someone or something else agrees with their assessment:</p>

              <p>We think this could be important for platforms to consider. Making the flagging process more visible may increase trust in the decisions they make to remove content.</p>
